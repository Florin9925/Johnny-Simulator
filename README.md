# Johnny-Simulator

## What's Johnny Simulator?

  Johnny is a simulator of a simple (virtual) von-Neumann Computer. Its principal application is education. Therefore a number of simplifications are made: rather reduced instruction sets and simplified bus operations.
  
  It visualizes the function of Memory, Arithmetic Logic Unit and Control Unit. Machine Programs can be created and edited using a comfortable GUI and run on the virtual machine step by step.
  
  ### Motivation 
  This application was made as a college assigment for a Computer Systems Architecture. 
  
  
  ## **Tech used:**
  For GUI we used PyQt.
